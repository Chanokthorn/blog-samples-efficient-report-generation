This repository serves as a sample for a series of Medium blogs
1. [Efficiently Handling Both Fast and Slow Report Generation in Golang â€” Part 1: Separating Generation Task to a Consumer Service](https://medium.com/@chanokthorn6/efficiently-handling-both-fast-and-slow-report-generation-in-golang-part-1-the-problem-e83b1fa37f2b).
2. Report Generation Job Done Notification With Redis PubSub (stay tuned...)


In this blog post, we will explore various techniques and best practices for generating reports efficiently in software applications. We will cover topics such as optimizing data retrieval, designing efficient report templates, and leveraging caching mechanisms to improve performance. 

Feel free to explore the code and accompanying documentation to gain insights into how to implement efficient report generation in your own projects.
